I implemented the extra credit (in an extra file, drop_file.js) via a new class. The user can create a small text file containing the description. Then they can drag their text file on top of the new card of their choosing to fill its description. The card will show a blue outline over it when the user drags the text file over the corresponding card. When the user "drops" the file on the card, the card's description is replaced with the text in the text file. All the other features of the website work as expected even with this extra credit component added.
