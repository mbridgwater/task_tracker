Note I removed the extra credit functionality that I had implemented for project 2 (as it said that was allowed). 
I did not implement the extra credit for project 3. Additionally, note that getColorHex.js was created with 
the help of chatgpt to reduce time to write the switch statement. Although using AI is usually not acceptable, 
it felt reasonable here since it is not used to assist in coding logic, but rather write the repetitive cases to 
save time. Further, this is not an essential part of my app, but rather mainly used with testing CSS predefined 
colors. I did also receive approval from professor in office hours that using chatgpt here in this specific case 
was OK.
